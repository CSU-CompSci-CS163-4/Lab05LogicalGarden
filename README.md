This is the public repository for the CS163/4 lab template. Each repository has one lab which consists of a skeleton, javadoc(generated from the solution), UML diagram, and writeup as the README.


## Javadoc
Here is the command for the javadoc

javadoc -d javadoc -private -noqualifier all -link https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/ ./src/* 

replace ./src/* with whatever the directory is you are running the javadoc on. We can also look at updating it, as there are a bunch of options I am not using.
